## Changelog

### 1.0.5
* CI: the release step no longer copies the staging directory into itself, so the ZIP has no empty `jpkcom-gutenberg-img-alt/jpkcom-gutenberg-img-alt/` folder
* CI: bumped the pinned GitHub Actions (checkout v7.0.1, setup-python v7.0.0, action-gh-release v3.0.2, fetch-metadata v3.1.0), still pinned to full commit SHAs
* CI: the release ZIP now excludes the development-only `tests/` and `tools/` directories
* CI: security and regression tests now run on every pull request, where a plugin has them

### 1.0.4
* Security: update packages are now verified *before* installation — the verified file is handed to WordPress instead of being downloaded a second time, so the bytes that were checked are the bytes that get installed
* Security: a missing or unfetchable SHA-256 checksum now aborts the update instead of installing unverified code (previously it silently skipped verification)
* Security: pinned every GitHub Action to a full commit SHA and added Dependabot with a 7-day cooldown, so a moved tag can no longer change the release build
* Security: tightened which download the updater claims, so sibling plugins cannot match each other's package
* Fixed: `sprintf()` calls in the updater bound named arguments to a variadic parameter, which raises `ArgumentCountError` on PHP 8.3
* Fixed: the "View Details" modal could fail with a `TypeError` when the manifest omitted `requires_plugins`
* Performance: a failed manifest fetch is now cached for an hour instead of being retried on every admin request
* Added: CI workflow on every pull request (PHP lint, named-argument check, YAML validation, action-pinning guard)

### 1.0.3
* Docs: linked the published PHPDoc API documentation

### 1.0.2
* Added secure self-hosted plugin updates via GitHub with SHA256 checksum verification
* Added an automated release workflow (builds the ZIP, generates the manifest and deploys to gh-pages on tag push)
* Raised the minimum WordPress version to 6.9 and "Tested up to" to WordPress 7.0
* Switched license metadata to the SPDX identifier `GPL-2.0-or-later` with the HTTPS license URI
* Added PHPDoc-generated API documentation, built and deployed to gh-pages on release
* Hardening: enabled `declare(strict_types=1)` and added precise closure parameter/return types

### 1.0.1
* Replacement bugfix

### 1.0.0
* Initial Release
